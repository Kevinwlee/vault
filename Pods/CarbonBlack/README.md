# To Develop For It

Carbon Black has a dependency on AFNetworking.  To develop on Carbon Black, use the CarbonBlack.xcworkspace.  

## Testing

Everything added to Carbon Black should have unit tests written for it using the XCTest framework. Find more information about XCTest on Apple's Developer Portal.

## Documentation

Everything added to Carbon Black should have appledoc style documentation headers on all public API methods. Find more information about appledoc on on the [appledoc project website](http://gentlebytes.com/appledoc/).

## Dependencies

Any dependency for the library needs to be added both to the Podfile (for testing and development) and the Podspec file (for deployment).  Reliance on 3rd party dependencies should be minimized.

## Continuous Integration
